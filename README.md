# Gamified Habit App

## Why this project?

As someone with ADHD I've learned some valuable lessons about choosing tools that work for my brain instead of choosing the tools society says _should_ work for my brain. Of the tools that work some of the most consistent are automation and gamificition. So far, however, I've found that many apps geared toward automation and/or gamification are really good at either automating habits and routines or gamifying habits and routines but there isn't an app or service (that I've seen) that really excels at both simultaniously. So the overall premise is to build a habit, routine and to-do tracker that automatically shows/sorts which habits, routines and task you want to complete, how many tasks you complete, and offers rewards for completing tasks.

## Project Tech Summary

This project will be to create a task, routine, and habit tracking app that is accessible in a web browser. The project will make use of Javascript and React for the front end, vite for setting up the coding environemnt, and Express and Postgres for the backend. For styling I'll be using tailwindcss, a utility first CSS framework.
