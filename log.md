# Production Log

## Description

This log will be to keep track of all of the **major challenges and hurdles**, what **_solution_** paths I attempt, as well as **_lessons learned_** in the process.

> I listened to a [podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/coding-bootcamps-coding-journeys) that reaffirmed my conviction behind doing this project. A bi-product of this project is being able to explain to future hiring managers how I solve problems. So I decided to take one from Harold's book and document my process so that when interview time comes around I have all my material in one place. _Also_ so everything doesn't just live in my head and no where else. It helps to solve problems to see what the problem is. (So in a sense, writing out my problems is a solution to its own problem!)
>
> As of right now I'm facing a few hurdles/decisions that will have impact on the outcome of this project.
>
> ### Switching To Typescript
>
> Should I learn it and migrate the project now so there will be less to migrate or should I wait? If I wait when should I wait until? The breakpoints that makes sense:
>
> 1.  After building all the static components of this project
> 1.  The end of Mod 3 / After learning Pursuit's React content
> 1.  After building the backend
> 1.  After mod 4 when we cover backend
>
> Most likely, seeing it written out, I'll go with one of the first two, based on which comes first. If both of those breakpoints pass and I dont use them, Ill go with last two, whichever comes first. By the last breakpoint I should have built the skills and features for the app that there really wont be anything in the way.
>
> ### ✅ Backend
>
> I know I will need a backend but I'm not sure if I should build the front end first or build the backend first. I think it makes more sense to build a mostly static front end and then build backend but I should do more research for that first.
>
> \*\*Edit: I did some research and my hunch was right. Front end first is how most apps are built. So I'm going to continue writing the front end and write the backend after.
>
> ### Workflow
>
> - Keeping a steady workflow for such a huge venture (as a solo dev project) is crazy intimidating and I know it wont get done unelss I have a plan. I created a preliminary one but I might need more research into how to manage a coding project and how to think about a coding projects in general. For now my plan is:
>   1.  ✅ Complete gold, crystals, and a daily summary for StatsCard
>   1.  Build the missions page set up (\*\*\*Updated after)
>   1.  Update none checklist dailies (currently called habits) to make the name, total, units and emoji (may replace emoji with a gold/xp symbol btw) editable and add "increment by", difficulty, notes and time
>   1.  Update dailies (currently called habits) to include checklist. If checklist is present the progress bar will update based on the % of completed checklist items. Name, emoji, difficulty, notes, and time will be editable.
>   1.  Build a habit component with a color indicator or how strong the habit is, difficulty, notes, reset interval
>   1.  Update Todo to make name and emoji editable and add difficulty and notes
>   1.  Build the timer, stop watch, and pomodoro "Tools" pages
>   1.  Convert to Typescript, build backend, and connect.
>   1.  Determine point logic (\*\*\*Updated after)
